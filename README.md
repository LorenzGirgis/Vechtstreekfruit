# Vechtstreek Fruit in kaart
#### By the the team of Brian, Christian, Lorenz, Ozan en Jayne

### Project information
For Bit Academy's Deep Dive, all students were required to do an assignment for a real-life client. For our team, we were assigned Vechtstreek Fruit by Willem Groeneveld. 

During our initial meeting, we learnt about Mr. Groeneveld's goals and ideas for this project.
As a result, we sat down as a team and brainstormed and discussed what we thought was important. 

Here's a quick summary: 
- Map with an overview with clear indication of the location of the trees, with an overview of information. 
- Clear and concise administration panel where the owner, or user's with access, can easily add and update relevant information to the map and the database. 
- General questionnaire regarding fruit sorts; for this demo we used apples.
- Redesign of the visuals of the current website, as we beleived this should be just as admirable with the goals of Mr.Groeneveld 
- Mobile friendly design as this was of importance to the wishes of the client.

Overall, we wanted to create a design that was intuitive, informative, and eye-catching. We believe we have accomplished all of this and met the client's  requirements. 

So, without further ado, let's get started on our project! 

### Vechtstreek Fruit
The digital fruit map lists all of the fruit trees in the Vecht region. Very fascinating and practical! For fruit professionals, management, but also for Vecht residents looking for that exceptional apple or pear for a yummy pie. 

We approached the map's design from a practical standpoint, wondering what we would want to see from a client's perspective as well as the usefulness from an owner's perspective. With an intuitive design that was welcoming and simple to use for everyone.

This concept inspired our solution on the admin page, in which people with appropriate permissions may easily change the list of their orchards.According to their contents, positions, varieties, tastes, yield amounts, and so on. All in a well-organized, informative panel. 

The concept for Mr. Groeneveld's company was inspiring, particularly his approach to reducing the carbon impact of fruits that would otherwise go to waste. Instead of letting fruits rot on the ground, which just adds to the greenhouse effect. But instead revitalising and repurposing these fruits into organic goods for everyone to enjoy. 

We wanted the design of the website to emphasize this objective. 

## Tech Stack

We used a number of open source platforms and frameworks to ensure all of this:

- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Tailwind is an open source CSS design framework.
- [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) - HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
- [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/) - A lightweight dynamic computer programming language, most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages.
- [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) - Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML. 
- [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) - Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standardized programming language that is used to manage relational databases and perform various operations on the data in them.
- [PDO](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php) - PHP Data Objects, also known as PDO, is an interface for accessing databases in PHP without tying code to a specific database.
- [PHP](https://www.php.net/) - PHP is a general-purpose scripting language geared toward web development.
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) - Leaflet is an open source JavaScript library used to build web mapping applications. 
- [Spline 3D](https://spline.design/) - Spline is an easy to use 3D design tool geared for any designer regardless of their 3D experience.

And of course our project itself is open source with a [Repository](https://github.com/LorenzGirgis/Vechtstreekfruit/tree/Brian) on GitHub.
